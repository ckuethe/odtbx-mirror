% defined in the ICD_GPS-200 as: 
% *       origin is the center of mass of the Earth 
% *       z-axis is parallel to the direction of the Conventional
%    International Origin (CIO) as defined by the Bureau International de'l Heure
%    (BIH), and passes through instantaneous pole of epoch 1984.0 
% *       x-axis is the intersection of the reference meridian plane and the
%    plane of the mean astronomic equator, with the reference meridian being
%    parallel to the zero meridian defined by the BIH 
% *       y-axis completes the system as a right-handed rectangular system 
% Some of the major constants in WGS-84, which models the Earth as an
% ellipsoid of revolution, are: 
% *       semimajor axis (origin to equator on x-y plane) = 6378.137 km 
% *       semiminor axis (origin to either pole) = 6356.7523142 km 
% *       flattening = 1/298.257223563 
% *       angular velocity of Earth = 7.292115e-5 radians/s 
% *       angular velocity of Earth (untruncated) = 7.2921151467e-5 radians/s 
%         (for precise satellite applications) 
% *       G x mass of Earth = 3.986005e14 m**3/s**2
