function gain = gps_gain(gps_meas, phys_param, RX_link, TX_link, pattern, ant)
%
% Calculates antenna gains from GPS physical parameters, CN0, and link budget data.
%
% Description: gps_gain calculates antenna gain as a function of boresight 
% azimuth and elvation angles and time for either the transmit antenna or 
% the receive antenna when provided with the remaining parts of the
% link budget.  The provided antenna pattern and ant flag specify which
% antenna gain is to be calculated.  The measured carrier to noise ratio 
% from the gps_meas struct is used along with the RX_link and TX_link structs
% and pattern to complete the link budget.
%
% The resulting gain data is only calculated if the provided data passes
% the following checks.  An empty gain array will be returned if no data
% can be processed.  gps_gain checks the phys_param.meta.TX_ID.GPS_PRN 
% against the values in gps_meas.GPS_PRN to be sure they are for the same 
% PRN value.  If there is no match then no calculations occur because the
% data is not for the same transmitter.  This tool checks the epoch 
% timestamps between the phys_param.epoch, and associated 
% gps_meas.PRN_data{}.epoch.  Only epochs that exactly match are processed.
% For a description of the link budget equations, see gpslinkbudget.
