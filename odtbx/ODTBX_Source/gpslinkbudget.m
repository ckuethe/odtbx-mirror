function [CN0, Ar, At, Ad, AP, RP] = gpslinkbudget(los_mag, RX_link, TX_link, rx_pattern, rx_el, rx_az, tx_pattern, tx_el, tx_az, CN0) 
%
% Calculates the GPS transmitter-receiver link budget.
%
% This calculates the full link budget between a GPS SV transmitter and a
% receiver system.  It includes the GPS SV transmitter power, the GPS
% antenna gain, the path loss, atmospheric attenuation, the receiver 
% antenna gain, the receiver system noise temperature, receiver system
% noise figures and losses, and received carrier to noise ratio.  It uses a
% set of system gain and loss constants with a set of distances and angles
% relative to the transmitter and receiver antennas to describe the link 
% budget geometry.
%
% Several methods of calculation can be used depending on the input
% specification:
% 1) Calculate CN0 (and other outputs) from both the transmit and receive
%    antenna patterns, the antenna angles, and the LOS magnitude.
% 2) Calculate Ar (and other outputs) from the transmit antenna pattern,
%    the transmit antenna angle(s), the LOS magnitude, and the CN0.
% 3) Calculate At (and other outputs) from the receive antenna pattern,
%    the receive antenna angle(s), the LOS magnitude, and the CN0.
%
% Either antenna pattern can be 1D, using only the antenna elevation
% angles, or 2D, using the antenna azimuth and elevation angles.  1D 
% patterns will ignore any supplied azimuth angle data.  Both types of 
% antenna angles must be supplied for a 2D antenna.  The transmit 
% antenna and receive antenna patterns can be different dimensions (i.e.
% one can be 1D while the other is 2D).
%
% If the receive pattern and receiver angles arguments are all empty then
% an ideal omnidirectional receive antenna with zero dB gain is assumed.
%
% Transmit or receive gains, At or Ar, are set to -100 dB if the angles are
% outside the prescribed pattern.  (This is not applied to the receive 
% gains with the omni receive option.)  All dependent outputs (CN0, RP, or 
% AP, as applicable) are biased as well.
