function TX_ID = makeGpsTXID(GPS_ID, GPS_PRN, block_type)
%
% Creates a blank data structure for describing a GPS transmitter.
%
% A GPS Transmitter ID is a way to uniquely identify a particular GPS
% transmitter.  It relates the GPS vehicle block type and the current 
% PRN assignment for that transmitter to a user-supplied GPS ID.  The PRN
% assignment for a particular GPS transmitter may change over time but the
% assigned GPS ID and block type should not change.
