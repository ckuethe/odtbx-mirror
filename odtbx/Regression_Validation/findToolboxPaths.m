function [toolboxPaths, otherPaths] = findToolboxPaths()
% Parses the MATLAB search paths and tries to determine which paths
% are for optional MATLAB toolboxes.  The toolboxPaths is a cell array
% of strings that are MATLAB toolbox paths.  Some paths with "toolbox"
% in them are ignored.  All paths that aren't directly MATLAB-related
% are placed in otherPaths, a cell array of strings.  The standard
% MATLAB paths under the toolbox directory are ignored.  Case-insensitive
% path comparisons are used.
